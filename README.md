# üì∂ QoS Classification in 5G Networks using Machine Learning

This repository contains the LaTeX report and documentation for a project focused on Quality of Service (QoS) classification in 5G networks using machine learning. The project explores how reinforcement learning and deep learning techniques can dynamically manage and classify QoS flows, contributing to more intelligent and adaptive 5G communication.

## üìò Overview

As 5G evolves to support a wide range of services‚Äîsuch as URLLC, eMBB, and mMTC‚Äîprecise and efficient Quality of Service (QoS) classification becomes essential. This project presents and compares multiple machine learning models, particularly Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and deep neural networks, for classifying and managing QoS flows based on real-time network parameters.

## üîç System Components

- **QoS Parameters**: Includes latency, bandwidth, reliability, jitter, and packet loss‚Äîcore indicators for service quality in 5G.

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**:
  - Uses PPO for adaptive, policy-based control in dynamic 5G environments.
  - Learns from network conditions and improves resource allocation through feedback.

- **Deep Learning (DL)**:
  - Employs CNNs and RNNs to recognize traffic patterns and detect anomalies.
  - Enhances prediction accuracy using high-dimensional signal features.

- **Hybrid Models**:
  - Future-ready architectures combining RL and DL to boost adaptability and precision in QoS classification.
